#FINAL PROJECT BY CAROLINE JONES AND GILLIAN FOSTER
SNOWY ARCADE:
In this final we made an arcade game where you have the option to choose from three different games!

The first game is the mountain maze!
Set the scene-
It is a snowy day on the mountain. You are able to choose to be a skier or snowboarder. 
Your goal? To get through the MOUNTAIN MAZE!! Try not to run into the white snowy mountain.
If you go too far off track you lose, if you make it to the green you win.
Exit the game using the escape key!

The second game is ping pong! The user controls the rackets, the left racket uses the q and a for up and down. The right racket uses the up arrow and down arrow keys. 
Velocity function controls the ball speed, and it bounces in random directions. The first player to get to five points wins! Exit the game using the escape key!

The third game is Dodge!
On another snowy day the user has to avoid rectangles of different sizes coming from all different directions.
If the user runs into a rectangle you lose, if the user makes it to the green at the top center of the game, you win!
Exit the game using the escape key!

Skills used in this project:

• Gillian Foster and Caroline Jones 
- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 4 concepts used
For our open-ended, we created a maze using 8-bit graphics and other graphics taught 
Through the module, the snow created in the second screen is from an in class activity.

- List of concepts used from module 2 and module 4:
  • Drawing
  • OpenGL and GLUT
  • Keyboard listener(s)
- Mouse listeners
  • Graphics with C++ classes
- Inheritance class relationship
  • Component class relationship


- Any known bugs at time of submission
Maze: User needs to have all points completely off of the maze track for it to lose.
Ping-Pong: Sometimes shows overlap of ball and paddle and can be a bit laggy sometimes
